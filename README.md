> [!NOTE]
> [Kenchi](https://kenchi.com/) was a privacy-first Chrome extension originally created to supercharge support tools, and built to be a generic sidebar for the internet. We unfortunately shut down in late 2022, but thought our app had enough novel technical approaches that made it worth open sourcingâ€”so here we are! Kenchi is now available under the MIT license. You'll find here an extension built to work reliably on any third-party site, chock-full of convenience features like a robust [message passing library](https://github.com/michaelschade/kenchi-message-router) built with extensions in mind, keyboard shortcuts, local caching, a GraphQL-driven webapp, robust reporting engine, fine-grained permissions, GitHub-style PRs for support content, a custom document editor, and much more.

> If you're looking to build your own support tools in house, or looking for inspiration from a battle tested Chrome extension, we hope you find this code heplful.

# Kenchi monorepo README

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since this was a commercial application, we had a number of licenses and custom IDs in use you'll need to update if you want to stand up the app in full:
>
> **Fonts**: If you'd like the site to look the same as our [production site](https://kenchi.com/), you'll need to purchase a license to the delightful [Neue Machina font](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-machina) by Pangram Pangram Foundry. Place these files in `packages/site/src/fonts/`: `PPNeueMachina-Light.woff`, `PPNeueMachina-Light.woff2`, `PPNeueMachina-Regular.woff`, and `PPNeueMachina-Regular.woff2`
>
> **Icons**: For FontAwesome Pro icons, [add your FontAwesome auth token to your .npmrc](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/packages)
>
> **env files**: We make references to our published Chrome IDs, Sentry DSN, and other unique IDs in various .env files. Update the various .env files (`find packages -name ".env*"`) with your own IDs.

## First time setup

* Install and start [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* `brew install node@16 pnpm tmux overmind postgres`
  * If your laptop has node install already you'll have the wrong version in your PATH. `brew` will display a message indicating this.
  * To check, run `node --version` and see if it's 16.
  * If it's not, run `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@16/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc` followed by `. ~/.zshrc` and try again.
* Set up git
  * Add your `@kenchi.com` email address [to your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/emails)
  * [Set up SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
  * `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  * `git config --global user.email "you@kenchi.com"`
* CloneÂ this repo via `git clone git@github.com:kenchi/kenchi.git`
* Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a personal access token with `repo` and `read:packages` permissions. No expiration is fine.
  * `npm config set "//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken" 264E9B96-1535-4EEB-B97E-F7E324F74805`
  * `npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
  * Enter your Github username, the access token you just made as the password, and your @kenchi.com email.
* `cp packages/backend/sample.env packages/backend/.env`
* `pnpm install`
* `./packages/backend/dev/init_env` (follow the instructions to install mkcert and update /etc/hosts)
* `pnpm -C packages/backend migrate up`

## Check out these READMEs

* `packages/backend/README.md`
* `packages/frontend/README.md`

## Running Kenchi

* `pnpm start:app` is the place to start, it'll run everything you need to work on Kenchi the application.
* `pnpm start` will also run admin and Kenchi website.

## Exploring the API

In dev, you can access the GraphQL playground at [https://api.kenchi.dev/playground](https://api.kenchi.dev/playground). Query to your heart's content! Try this for example:

  ```gql
  {
    viewer {
      user {
        id
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Deploying

### Production

1. Merge your PR
2. Make sure the tests pass on `main`. Head to [https://github.com/kenchi/kenchi/commits/main](https://github.com/kenchi/kenchi/commits/main) and wait for that green check mark next to your commit. âœ…
3. Pull the latest `main`.
4. Push to the prod branch for the service you wish to deploy. You can see the full list of prod branches at [https://github.com/kenchi/kenchi/branches/all?query=prod](https://github.com/kenchi/kenchi/branches/all?query=prod). For the frontend for example, do

  ```sh
  git push origin main:prod-frontend
  ```

From there, Render will take over and deliver your code to our customers. You can observe the deploy process in [the Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).

A cautionary note: Render will gladly deploy a broken branch! If things somehow go south, fear not. You can [rollback to an earlier, happy deploy in Render](https://render.com/docs/rollbacks).

### Staging

To deploy your branch to staging, simply push your branch (ex: `my-nifty-branch`) to the `staging` branch on origin like so:

```sh
git push origin my-nifty-branch:staging
```
