It strengthens and builds on the EU‚Äôs current data protection framework, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive.</p>
<p>The GDPR sets out the rules for how personal data must be collected, processed and stored by organizations operating in the EU. It also establishes new rights for individuals with respect to their personal data.</p>
<p>Organizations that process the personal data of EU citizens must comply with the GDPR unless they can demonstrate that they meet certain conditions.</p>
<h2>What is a Sub Processor?</h2>
<p>A sub processor is a third party that processes personal data on behalf of a controller or processor. A sub processor may be located in the European Union or in a third country.</p>
<p>Under the GDPR, controllers and processors must enter into a written contract with any sub processors they engage. The contract must set out the specific obligations of the sub processor with respect to the personal data being processed.</p>
<p>Organizations that engage sub processors must also ensure that the sub processor does not engage any further sub processors without the prior written authorization of the controller or processor.</p>
<h2>What is the purpose of this document?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a list of GDPR sub processors that support team [Tier 1] uses.</p>
<p>This list will be updated on a regular basis as new sub processors are engaged or as existing sub processors are removed.</p>

        contents: `<p>This internal wiki guide is for the support team and covers billing-related questions on tax and value-added tax (VAT).</p>
<h2>What is tax?</h2>
<p>Tax is a mandatory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures. A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law.</p>
<h2>What is value-added tax (VAT)?</h2>
<p>Value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax levied on the sale of goods and services. It is imposed at each stage of the production and distribution process, from the initial purchase of raw materials to the final sale of the finished product. The tax is typically calculated as a percentage of the selling price of the good or service.</p>
<h2>What are the different types of taxes?</h2>
<p>There are many different types of taxes, but the most common are income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and corporate taxes. Other less common types of taxes include sin taxes (e.g. on alcohol and tobacco), import/export taxes, and payroll taxes.</p>
<h2>How does taxation work?</h2>
<p>Taxation works by levying a financial charge on taxpayers. The charge is typically calculated as a percentage of the taxpayer's income, sales, property value, or assets. The taxpayer is then required to pay the tax to the government.</p>
<h2>What are the different types of tax systems?</h2>
<p>There are many different types of tax systems, but the most common are progressive, regressive, and proportional.</p>
<p>Progressive tax systems tax individuals at higher rates as their income increases. This type of system is often used to fund social welfare programs.</p>
<p>Regressive tax systems tax individuals at lower rates as their income increases. This type of system is often used to fund flat-rate government programs like national defense.</p>
<p>Proportional tax systems tax individuals at the same rate regardless of their income. This type of system is often used to fund specific government programs or services.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between a tax and a fee?</h2>
<p>A tax is a mandatory financial charge imposed by the government, while a fee is a voluntary charge imposed by a private entity.</p>

<p>We're happy to help you get started with this process. VAT is a value added tax that is applied to certain goods and services in the European Union. In order to comply with EU VAT laws, businesses must register for a VAT number and charge VAT on their products and services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up VAT for your SaaS product. First, you will need to register for a VAT number with the EU. You can find more information on how to do this here: [link to VAT registration website]. Once you have a VAT number, you will need to add it to your account settings in your SaaS product.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have registered for a VAT number and added it to your account, you will need to start charging VAT on your products and services. You can find more information on how to do this here: [link to VAT charging website].</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for your time and we hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out to us about your declined credit card. We're sorry to hear that you're having trouble using your card.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are a few reasons why your card may have been declined. One possibility is that the billing address you have on file with your credit card company doesn't match the address you entered when you were trying to make your purchase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another possibility is that your credit card company has flagged your account as being potentially fraudulent. If this is the case, you'll need to contact your credit card company to resolve the issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We understand that it can be frustrating to have your credit card declined. We hope that this information is helpful and that you'll be able to resolve the issue with your credit card company soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out to us! In general, VAT is a tax that is levied on the sale of goods and services in the European Union. The current VAT rate in the EU is 20%. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, VAT does not apply to the sale of digital goods, such as e-books, online courses, or software. Additionally, VAT does not apply to the sale of goods that are shipped outside of the EU.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us about VAT. We are happy to provide some information about VAT and how it works with our service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VAT, or value-added tax, is a tax that is levied on the value of goods and services. In many countries, VAT is levied on the sale of goods and services, and the amount of tax is based on the value of the good or service. VAT is typically a percentage of the sale price, and the rate can vary depending on the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the European Union, VAT is levied on the sale of goods and services within the EU. The rate of VAT varies from country to country, and the amount of tax that is due is based on the value of the good or service. For example, in Germany the VAT rate is 19%, and in the Netherlands the VAT rate is 21%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are a business that sells goods or services within the EU, you are required to charge VAT on your sales. You will then need to remit the VAT to the tax authority in the country where the sale took place. For example, if you are a German business and you sell a good or service to a customer in the Netherlands, you will need to charge Dutch VAT on the sale and remit the VAT to the Dutch tax authorities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are a business that sells goods or services outside of the EU, you are not required to charge VAT on your sales. However, you may be required to remit VAT to the tax authority in the country where the sale took place. For example, if you are a German business and you sell a good or service to a customer in the United States, you will not need to charge VAT on the sale, but you may need to remit VAT to the US tax authorities.</p>

<h2>Advanced roles:</h2>
<p>There are three advanced roles that can be assigned to users in an enterprise or account managed account: Administrator, Manager, and Member.</p>
<p>Administrators have full access to all features and settings in an enterprise or account managed account. They can add and remove users, change account settings, and create and manage groups.</p>
<p>Managers have access to most features and settings in an enterprise or account managed account. They can add and remove users, change account settings, and create and manage groups. They cannot, however, delete the account or change the billing settings.</p>
<p>Members have limited access to an enterprise or account managed account. They can view account settings and groups, but cannot make any changes.</p>
<h2>Groups:</h2>
<p>Groups are a way to organize users in an enterprise or account managed account. Groups can be used to control access to features and data, and to make it easier to manage large numbers of users.</p>
<p>There are two types of groups: static and dynamic. Static groups are created by an administrator or manager, and cannot be changed by members. Dynamic groups are created by members, and can be changed by anyone in the group.</p>
<p>Static groups are typically used to control access to features and data. For example, an administrator might create a static group for all users who should have access to a certain feature.</p>
<p>Dynamic groups are typically used to make it easier to manage large numbers of users. For example, a manager might create a dynamic group for all users in a certain department.</p>
<h2>Permissions:</h2>
<p>Permissions control what users can do in an enterprise or account managed account. There are four types of permissions: read, write, execute, and delete.</p>
<p>Read permissions allow a user to view data. Write permissions allow a user to edit data. Execute permissions allow a user to run programs. Delete permissions allow a user to delete data.</p>
<p>Permissions can be assigned to users or groups. When a permission is assigned to a group, all members of that group will have the permission. When a permission is assigned to a user, only that user will have the permission.</p>
<p>To assign permissions, an administrator or manager must first create a group. Then, they can add users to the group and assign permissions to the group.</p>

<h2>Enterprise Accounts</h2>
<p>Audit logs for enterprise accounts are now available in the Admin Console. To view the audit logs, go to Admin Console > Security > Audit Logs.</p>

<h2>Alerts</h2>
<p>Both enterprise and account managed accounts have the same features for audit logs. However, account managed accounts have an additional feature that allows you to set up alerts for certain activities. For example, you can set up an alert so that you're notified whenever someone logs in from a new IP address.</p>
<p>To set up an alert, go to Account Manager > Security > Audit Logs, and then click the "Alerts" tab. From there, you can create a new alert and specify the conditions that will trigger it.</p>

<h2>Adding the SAML Certificate to the SAML Application</h2>

        contents: `<p>Localization requests can come in from a variety of sources - from users submitting tickets or feature requests, to developers submitting code changes. It's important that we have a standard process for handling these requests so that we can ensure timely and accurate responses.</p>
<p>Here's a basic overview of how to triage localization requests:</p>
<h2>Check if the request is already in progress</h2>
<p>Before starting any work on a new localization request, it's important to check if someone else on the team is already working on it. This can save a lot of time and duplication of effort.</p>
<p>To do this, check the team's localization request tracker. If the request is already listed there, no further action is needed - someone on the team is already working on it. Share our roadmap with this user:</p>
<tool tool="Localization roadmap"></tool>
<tool tool="TY for feedback"></tool>
<h2>Evaluate the request</h2>
<p>If the request is not already in progress, the next step is to evaluate it. This involves determining whether the request is a valid localization request, and whether it can be completed within the team's current capacity.</p>
<p>To do this, first check that the request meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>The request is for a new localization, or an update to an existing localization</p>
<p>The request is complete and includes all relevant information (e.g. file name, line number, English text, desired translation)</p>
<p>The request is clear and concise, and does not require additional clarification</p>
<p>If the request meets all of the above criteria, the next step is to check whether it can be completed within the team's current capacity. This involves considering the following factors:</p>
<p>The size of the requested localization (e.g. a few words, a sentence, a paragraph, an entire page)</p>
<p>The complexity of the requested localization (e.g. simple text, complex text with multiple variables, text with HTML markup)</p>
<p>The team's current workload and priorities</p>
<p>If the team has the capacity to complete the request, then it can be assigned to a member of the team for completion. If the team does not have the capacity to complete the request, then it may need to be deferred to a later time, or an alternative solution may need to be sought.</p>
<h2>Assign the request</h2>
<p>If the request is determined to be a valid localization request that can be completed within the team's current capacity, the next step is to assign it to a member of the team.</p>
<p>The request can be assigned to any team member, but it's generally best to assign it to someone who is available and has the relevant skills and experience.</p>
<h2>Complete the request</h2>
<p>Once the request has been assigned, it's the responsibility of the team member to complete the work. This involves carrying out the localization request, and then updating the relevant files and systems.</p>
<p>Once the request has been completed, the team member will update the localization request tracker to reflect the status of the request.</p>

<p>Product feature requests can come in through a variety of channels - email, phone, social media, in-app feedback forms, etc. It can be difficult to keep track of all of these requests and to decide which ones to prioritize. This is where triage comes in.</p>
<p>Triage is the process of assessing and prioritizing product feature requests. The goal is to identify the requests that are most important to the company and its customers, and to prioritize these requests for the development team.</p>
<p>There are a few different factors to consider when triaging product feature requests:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The customer's needs: What is the customer trying to accomplish with this request? Is it a must-have for them? How many other customers are requesting the same thing?</p></li>
<li><p>The company's goals: What is the company trying to achieve? Does this request align with the company's goals?</p></li>
<li><p>The feasibility of the request: Can we actually build this? Is it technically possible? How much effort will it take?</p></li>
<li><p>The impact of the request: How will this request impact the product? Will it be a small change or a major overhaul? How many other areas of the product will be affected?</p></li>
<li><p>The timing of the request: Is this something that the customer needs right away? Can it wait a few months?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these factors, you can prioritize product feature requests. The most important requests should be given to the development team as soon as possible, while less important requests can be scheduled for later.</p>
<p>When in doubt, it's always a good idea to consult with the customer or with other stakeholders to get more information about a request. And, of course, keep track of all requests so that you can follow up and provide updates to the customer.</p>
